## Splunk Nozzle

Cloud Foundry Firehose-to-Splunk Nozzle

### Usage
Splunk nozzle is used to stream Cloud Foundry Firehose events to Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Using pre-defined Splunk sourcetypes, the nozzle automatically parses the events and enriches them with additional metadata before forwarding to Splunk. For detailed descriptions of each Firehose event type and their fields, refer to underlying [dropsonde protocol](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol). Below is a mapping of each Firehose event type to its corresponding Splunk sourcetype. Refer to [Searching Events](#searching-events) for example Splunk searches.

| Firehose event type | Splunk sourcetype | Description
|---|---|---
| Error | `cf:error` | An Error event represents an error in the originating process
| HttpStartStop | `cf:httpstartstop` | An HttpStartStop event represents the whole lifecycle of an HTTP request
| LogMessage | `cf:logmessage` | A LogMessage contains a "log line" and associated metadata
| ContainerMetric | `cf:containermetric` | A ContainerMetric records resource usage of an app in a container
| CounterEvent | `cf:counterevent` | A CounterEvent represents the increment of a counter
| ValueMetric | `cf:valuemetric` | A ValueMetric indicates the value of a metric at an instant in time

In addition, logs from the nozzle itself are of sourcetype `cf:splunknozzle`.

### Setup

The Nozzle requires a client with the authorities `doppler.firehose` and `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` (the latter is only required if `ADD_APP_INFO` is enabled) and grant-types `client_credentials` and `refresh_token`. If `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` is not
available in the system, switch to use `cloud_controller.admin`.

You can either
* Add the client manually using [uaac](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac)
* Add the client to the deployment manifest; see [uaa.scim.users](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/blob/master/jobs/uaa/spec)

Manifest example:

```yaml

# Clients
uaa.clients:
    splunk-firehose:
      id: splunk-firehose
      override: true
      secret: splunk-firehose-secret
      authorized-grant-types: client_credentials,refresh_token
      authorities: doppler.firehose,cloud_controller.admin_read_only
```

`uaac` example:
```shell
uaac target https://uaa.[system domain url]
uaac token client get admin -s [admin client credentials secret]
uaac client add splunk-firehose --name splunk-firehose
uaac client add splunk-firehose --secret [your_client_secret]
uaac client add splunk-firehose --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token
uaac client add splunk-firehose --authorities doppler.firehose,cloud_controller.admin_read_only

```

`cloud_controller.admin_read_only` will work for cf v241
or later. Earlier versions should use `cloud_controller.admin` instead.

* `DROP_WARN_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for the count of dropped events in case the downstream is slow. Based on the threshold, the errors will be logged.

__About app cache params:__

When ADD_APP_INFO config is enabled, the nozzle will enrich the event with app metadata. For this, the nozzle maintains a cache of all the apps locally so that it doesn’t need to query from remote every time.

Now, when there is a change in this app data in remote, the nozzle has to update this local cache. For this, the config has APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL parameter. At every APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL interval, the nozzle will update the local cache by querying the remote (CF APIs).

If APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL is set to 10s, the nozzle will refresh the local cache at every 10s. So, AppCacheTTL should be set based on how frequently the app data is expected to change.

When the nozzle receives events from the doppler, it will check the local cache for the given app-id. But on cache-miss, it will query remote for that specific app. If it doesn’t find the app data from remote too, then the nozzle will add that app to MissingAppCache (if IGNORE_MISSING_APP config is **enabled**. so that the nozzle does not waste time in querying the remote for an app which is likely not to be found). So, from the next time onwards, the nozzle will first check in the MissingAppCache, if found then it will ignore the app and move on to the next event with a warning.

MISSING_APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL is used to clear the MissingAppCache so nozzle can retry querying from remote.

For example, given MISSING_APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL is set to 60s, when nozzle receives event from app that is not available in local cache and remote, it’ll add it to MissingAppCache. Until next MISSING_APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL, nozzle will not query from remote for the missing app.

### Push as an App to Cloud Foundry

Push Splunk Firehose Nozzle as an application to Cloud Foundry. Please refer to **Setup** section for details
on user authentication. 

1. Download the latest release

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/splunk-firehose-nozzle.git
    cd splunk-firehose-nozzle
    ```

1. Authenticate to Cloud Foundry

    ```shell
    cf login -a https://api.[your cf system domain] -u [your id]
    ```

1. Copy the manifest template and fill in needed values (using the credentials created during setup)

    ```shell
    vim .github/workflows/ci_nozzle_manifest.yml
    ```

1. Push the nozzle

    ```shell
    make deploy-nozzle
    ```

#### Dump application info to boltdb ####
If in production there are lots of CF applications(say tens of thousands) and if the user would like to enrich
application logs by including application meta data,querying all application metadata information from CF may take some time.
For example if we include, add app name, space ID, space name, org ID and org name to the events.
If there are multiple instances of Spunk nozzle deployed the situation will be even worse, since each of the Splunk nozzle(s) will query all applications meta data and
cache the meta data information to the local boltdb file. These queries will introduce load to the CF system and could potentially take a long time to finish.
Users can run this tool to generate a copy of all application meta data and copy this to each Splunk nozzle deployment. Each Splunk nozzle can pick up the cache copy and update the cache file incrementally afterwards.

Example of how to run the dump application info tool:

```
$ cd tools/dump_app_info
$ go build dump_app_info.go
$ ./dump_app_info --skip-ssl-validation --api-endpoint=https://<your api endpoint> --user=<api endpoint login username> --password=<api endpoint login password>
```

After populating the application info cache file, user can copy to different Splunk nozzle deployments and start Splunk nozzle to pick up this cache file by
specifying correct "--boltdb-path" flag or "BOLTDB_PATH" environment variable.

### Disable logging for noisy applications
Set F2S_DISABLE_LOGGING = true as a environment variable in applications's manifest to disable logging.


## Index routing
Index routing is a feature that can be used to send different Cloud Foundry logs to different indexes for better ACL and data retention control in Splunk.

### Per application index routing via application manifest
To enable per app index routing, 
* Please set environment variable `SPLUNK_INDEX` in your application's manifest ([example below](#example-manifest-file))
* Make sure Splunk nozzle is configured with `ADD_APP_INFO` (Select at least one of AppName,OrgName,OrgGuid,SpaceName,SpaceGuid) to enable app info caching
* Make sure `SPLUNK_INDEX` specified in app's manifest exist in Splunk and can receive data for the configured Splunk HEC token.

> **WARNING**: If `SPLUNK_INDEX` is invalid, events from other apps may also get lost as splunk will drop entire event batch if any of the event from batch is invalid (i.e. invalid index)

There are two ways to set the variable: 

In your app manifest provide an environment variable called `SPLUNK_INDEX` and assign it the index you would like to send the app data to.

#### Example Manifest file
```
applications:
- name: <App-Name>
  memory: 256M
  disk_quota: 256M
  ...
  env:
    SPLUNK_INDEX: <SPLUNK_INDEX>
    ...
```

You can also update the env on the fly using cf-cli command:
```
cf set-env <APP_NAME> SPLUNK_INDEX <ENV_VAR_VALUE>
```
#### Please note
> If you are updating env on the fly, make sure that `APP_CACHE_INVALIDATE_TTL` is greater tha 0s. Otherwise cached app-info will not be updated and events will not be sent to required index.


### Index routing via Splunk configuration
Logs can be routed using fields such as app ID/name, space ID/name or org ID/name.
Users can configure the Splunk configuration files props.conf and transforms.conf on Splunk indexers or Splunk Heavy Forwarders if deployed.

Below are few sample configuration: 

<span>1. </span> Route data from application ID `95930b4e-c16c-478e-8ded-5c6e9c5981f8` to a Splunk `prod` index:

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:logmessage]
TRANSFORMS-index_routing = route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_app_id
```


*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_app_id]
REGEX = "(\w+)":"95930b4e-c16c-478e-8ded-5c6e9c5981f8"
DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
FORMAT = prod
```


<span>2.</span> Routing application logs from any Cloud Foundry orgs whose names are prefixed with `sales` to a Splunk `sales` index.

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:logmessage]
TRANSFORMS-index_routing = route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_org_name

```

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_data_to_index_by_field_cf_org_name]
REGEX = "cf_org_name":"(sales.*)"
DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
FORMAT = sales
```

<span>3.</span> Routing data from sourcetype `cf:splunknozzle` to index `new_index`:
 
*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/props.conf*
```
[cf:splunknozzle]
TRANSFORMS-route_to_new_index = route_to_new_index
```

*$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/transforms.conf*
```
[route_to_new_index]
SOURCE_KEY = MetaData:Sourcetype
DEST_KEY =_MetaData:Index
REGEX = (sourcetype::cf:splunknozzle)
FORMAT = new_index
```

## <a id='walkthrough'></a> Troubleshooting
This topic describes how to troubleshoot Splunk Firehose Nozzle for Cloud Foundry.

#### 1. I can't find my data!

  Are you searching for events and not finding them or looking at a dashboard and seeing "No result found"? Check Splunk Nozzle app logs.

  To view the nozzle's logs running on CF do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Log in as an admin via the CLI.</li>
  <li>Target the org created by the tile.<br/>
  <pre class="terminal">cf target -o SPLUNK-NOZZLE-ORG</pre>
  </li>
  <li>View the recent app Splunk Nozzle logs (the version number installed by the tile will vary).<br/>
  <pre class="terminal">cf logs --recent splunk-firehoze-nozzle</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Alternatively, you can stream the app logs as they're emitted.<br/>
  <pre class="terminal">cf logs splunk-firehose-nozzle</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


### Here are a few common errors and possible resolutions:

#### Splunk configuration related errors:

<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Unable to talk to Splunk","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Post http://localhost:8088/services/collector: read tcp 10.0.0.0:62931-\u003elocalhost:8088: read: connection reset by peer"}}</pre>

This error usually occurs when SSL is enabled on the Splunk HEC endpoint. Confirm that you're using https' in the Splunk HEC URL.


<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Unable to talk to Splunk","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Non-ok response code [400] from splunk: {\"text\":\"Incorrect index\",\"code\":7,\"invalid-event-number\":1}"}}</pre>

This usually means the index value specified in the configuration doesn't exist on Splunk Host. Confirm that you're using the correct Splunk index value.

  
<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Unable to talk to Splunk","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Non-ok response code [403] from splunk: {\"text\":\"Invalid token\",\"code\":4}"}}</pre>

This can occur when the Splunk HEC Token value is invalid. Confirm that you're using a valid token.

<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Unable to talk to Splunk","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Post https://localhost:8088/services/collector: x509: cannot validate certificate for localhost because it doesn't contain any IP SANs"}}</pre>

This usually means that there was no valid SSL certificate found. Confirm that you're using a valid SSL certificate for the Splunk server, or set 'Skip SSL Validation' to `true` under Splunk settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>Disabling SSL validation is not recommended for production environments.</p>


<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Unable to talk to Splunk","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Post https://localhost:8088/services/collector: dial tcp localhost:8088: getsockopt: connection refused"}}</pre>

This error can occur when the Splunk server is offline or when the Splunk HEC URL is not valid. Confirm that both the Splunk server is running and that you're using a valid URL. 

#### Cloud Foundry configuration related errors:

<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Failed to run splunk-firehose-nozzle","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Error getting token: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 401 Unauthorized\nResponse: {\"error\":\"unauthorized\",\"error_description\":\"Bad credentials\"}"}}</pre>

This error can occur when the credentials provided for CF environment are invalid. Confirm that the API User and API Password each have access to the CF environment. 


<pre class="terminal">{"timestamp":"<time>","source":"splunk-nozzle-logger","message":"splunk-nozzle-logger.Failed to run splunk-firehose-nozzle","log_level":2,"data":{"error":"Could not get api /v2/info: Get https://api.cfendpoint.com/v2/info: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority"}}</pre>

This means that no valid SSL certificate was found. To remediate this error, provide a valid SSL certificate for Cloud Foundry or set 'Skip SSL Validation' to true under Cloud Foundry Settings.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>Disabling SSL validation is not recommended for production environments.</p>

The following troubleshooting tips assume you have access to Splunk to run basic searches against index `_internal` and the user-specified index for Firehose events.

### 2. Ensure Splunk Nozzle is forwarding events from the Firehose:

Search app logs of the Nozzle to confirm correct behavior:

<pre class="terminal">
sourcetype="cf:splunknozzle"
</pre>

A correct setup logs a start message with configuration parameters of the Nozzle logged as a JSON object, for example:

<pre class="terminal">
  data:	{
     add-app-info: AppName,OrgName,OrgGuid,SpaceName,SpaceGuid
     api-endpoint: https://api.endpoint.com
     app-cache-ttl: 0
     app-limits: 0
     batch-size: 1000
     boltdb-path: cache.db
     branch: null
     buildos: null
     commit: null
     debug:	 false
     extra-fields:
     flush-interval: 5000000000
     hec-workers: 8
     ignore-missing-apps: true
     job-host:
     job-index: -1
     job-name: splunk-nozzle
     keep-alive: 25000000000
     missing-app-cache-ttl:	 0
     queue-size: 10000
     retries: 2
     skip-ssl: true
     splunk-host: http://localhost:8088
     splunk-index: atomic
     subscription-id: splunk-firehose
     trace-logging: true
     status-monitor-interval: 0s
     version:
     wanted-events: ValueMetric,CounterEvent,Error,LogMessage,HttpStartStop,ContainerMetric
  }
  ip: 10.0.0.0
  log_level: 1
  logger_source: splunk-nozzle-logger
  message: splunk-nozzle-logger.Running splunk-firehose-nozzle with following configuration variables
  origin: splunk_nozzle
</pre>

  Search app logs of the Nozzle for any errors:
<pre class="terminal">
sourcetype="cf:splunknozzle" data.error=*
</pre>

Errors are logged with corresponding message and stacktrace.

### 3. Check for dropped events due to HTTP Event Collector availability:

As the Splunk Firehose Nozzle sends data to Splunk via HTTPS using the HTTP Event Collector, it is also susceptible to any network issues across the network path from point to point. Run the following search to determine if Splunk has indexed any events indicating issues with the HEC Endpoint.

<pre class="terminal">
  sourcetype="cf:splunknozzle" "dropping events"
</pre>

### 4. Check for dropped events due to slow downstream(Network/Splunk):

If the nozzle emits the ‘dropped events’ warning saying that downstream is slow, then the network or Splunk environment might needs to be scaled. (eg. Splunk HEC receiver node, Splunk Indexer, LB etc)

Run the following search to determine if Splunk has indexed any events indicating such issues.

<pre class="terminal">
  sourcetype="cf:splunknozzle" "dropped Total of"
</pre>

### 5. Check for data loss inside the Splunk Firehose Nozzle:

If "Event Tracing" is enabled, extra metadata will be attached to events. This allows searches to calculate the percentage of data loss inside the Splunk Firehose Nozzle, if applicable.

Each instance of the Splunk Firehose Nozzle will run with a randomly generated UUID. The query below will display the message success rate for each UUID (Please update the index value based on your nozzle configuration).

<pre class="terminal">
index=main | stats count as total_events, min(nozzle-event-counter) as min_number, max(nozzle-event-counter) as max_number by uuid | eval event_number =  max_number - min_number | eval success_percentage = total_events/event_number*100 | stats max(success_percentage) by uuid
</pre>

### 6. Authentication is not working even if correct CF Client ID/secret is configured: (applicable in v1.2.3)

Due to a known issue in an indirect dependency (an OAuth library), if the client secret has any special characters (eg. *!#$&@^) then it will not work. For now, user has to configure a client secret without any of this characters. Once the library in question is updated in the next release it will work even with the special characters.

#### Searching Events

Here are two short Splunk queries to start exploring some of the Cloud Foundry events in Splunk.

```
sourcetype="cf:valuemetric"
    | stats avg(value) by job_instance, name
```

```
sourcetype="cf:counterevent"
    | eval job_and_name=source+"-"+name
    | stats values(job_and_name)
```

### 7. Nozzle is not collecting any data with 'websocket' (bad handshake) error

If the nozzle reports below error, then check if the configured "subscription-id" has '#' as a prefix. Please remove the prefix or prepend any other character than '#' to fix this issue.
```
Error dialing trafficcontroller server: websocket: bad handshake.\nPlease ask your Cloud Foundry Operator to check the platform configuration (trafficcontroller is wss://****:443).
```
